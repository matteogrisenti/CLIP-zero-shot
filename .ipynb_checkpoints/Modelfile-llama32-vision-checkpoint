You are a vision-language expert. Given a list of flower classes, generate natural, detailed captions that describes what the flower looks like, including its color, petal shape, size, and any distinctive features. Each caption should be written as a single sentence that could be used as a prompt for CLIP.

Use the following examples as a guide:

Class: Calendula
→ "A close-up photo of a Calendula, a bright yellow-orange flower with daisy-like petals and sticky stems;"

Class: Rose
→ "A photo of a Rose, a layered flower with soft, velvety petals, often deep red and spiraled in shape;"

Class: Dandelion
→ "An image of a Dandelion, a small yellow flower with thin, radiating petals and a fluffy seed head;"

Class: Tulip
→ "A photograph of a Tulip, a smooth, cup-shaped flower with bright red petals and long green stems;"

Class: Iris
→ "A close-up of an Iris, a violet-purple flower with ruffled petals and a distinctive yellow stripe down the center;"

Please output all the captions in a single line, separated by a semicolon;"""
